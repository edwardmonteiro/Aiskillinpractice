# Execution & Comms — ExCo

## Pyramid Narrative
- Answer: Double down on SLA reliability in SP while piloting premium and expansion plays that reuse the SP playbook.
- Supporting Points (with evidence):
  1) Route quality + supply depth fixes recover NPS and margins in SP (fact pack, routing logs).
  2) Premium SLA tier monetizes reliability for top B2B merchants (merchant interviews, willingness tests).
  3) Harmonized data/ops unlock faster city launches (benchmark vs. current debt).

## OKRs
| Objective | Key Results | Owner | Timing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Restore SP SLA reliability | On-time deliveries > 96%; reassignments -25% | Ops Lead | Q3 |
| Monetize reliability | Premium SLA pilot with 20 B2B merchants; +8pt NPS | Growth Lead | Q3 |
| Prep expansion | Data model harmonized across 3 cities; launch playbook ready | Engineering Lead | Q3 |

## Execution Backbone
- Initiatives: Routing optimization spike; incentive redesign; premium tier pricing test; data model harmonization; city expansion prep.
- Cadence (standups/steerco): Weekly working standup; biweekly steerco; monthly ExCo readout.
- Risks & Mitigations: Routing data quality (add observability), driver churn risk (targeted retention offers), merchant adoption (pricing tests).
- Reporting Artifacts: SLA dashboard, premium pilot tracker, expansion readiness checklist.
- Next Actions: Confirm owners; publish OKRs in PMO tool; start routing spike with engineering.
