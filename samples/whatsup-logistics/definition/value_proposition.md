## Core Promise
"Deliver every parcel on time through a WhatsApp-native operations command center that keeps dispatchers, riders, and customers perfectly synchronized across Brazil."

## Target Segments
- **Enterprise retailers** with high same-day delivery volume in São Paulo and Rio needing dependable SLA adherence.
- **Regional pharmacies and grocers** expanding hyperlocal delivery in Belo Horizonte and Recife.
- **Independent courier cooperatives** seeking automation without forcing drivers onto complex apps.

## Differentiators
1. **WhatsApp-first experience** with pre-approved Portuguese templates, quick replies, and live location cards.
2. **Predictive delay detection** leveraging traffic and weather feeds tailored to Brazilian roads.
3. **Driver-friendly workflows** that respect device limits, enable pause/resume tracking, and integrate PIX payouts.
4. **Skill-governed operations** ensuring every step—from research to release—follows audited AI guidance.

## Proof Points
- Pilot in São Paulo improved on-time delivery by 17% within 6 weeks.
- 92% of drivers reported the WhatsApp flow was easier than the legacy mobile app.
- Dispatchers reduced manual check-ins by 70%, freeing capacity for high-priority orders.

## Next Steps

- Feed differentiators into [`roadmap.md`](../delivery/roadmap.md).
