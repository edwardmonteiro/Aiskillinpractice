# WhatsUp Logistics Sample Application

This directory contains the full set of artifacts generated by applying every skill in the repository to the WhatsUp Logistics delivery service. The service coordinates motorcycle couriers across Brazil through WhatsApp and demonstrates an AI-first workflow powered by Claude skills and the spec-kit SDD template.

## Structure
- `discovery/` — Research, market, risk, and data insights captured with discovery skills.
- `definition/` — Strategy, OKRs, story maps, and testing approaches shaping delivery scope.
- `delivery/` — SDD alignment, MCP session summaries, technical specs, dashboards, testing, and launch materials.
- `data/` — Analytics engineering, data science, ML engineering, and decision briefs powering WhatsApp-native insights.
- `run/` — Production runbooks and incident coordination plans for on-call teams.
- `optimization/` — Experiments, metrics, retrospectives, and quality reports post-launch.
- `governance/` — Skill release governance to treat prompts as code.
- `skill-run-log.json` — Chronological log showing which agent executed each skill, the inputs used, and resulting artifacts.
