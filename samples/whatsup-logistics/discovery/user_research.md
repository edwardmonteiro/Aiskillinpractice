# Discovery · User Research

## Research Plan
- **Persona:** Dispatch supervisors in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, motorcycle drivers operating in favelas and downtown corridors.
- **Method:** Remote contextual inquiry via WhatsApp voice notes and screen recording of current coordination tactics.
- **Goals:** Identify breakdowns in location sharing, understand driver incentives, validate comfort with automation.

## Interview Guide Highlights
1. Walk through the last incident where a package arrived late—what communication channels were used?
2. How do you confirm a driver's availability when a new order arrives?
3. What information would reduce customer calls during delays?
4. How do drivers feel about sharing live location continuously through WhatsApp?
5. What backup plans exist when cellular coverage drops?

## Synthesis
- Dispatchers manually ping each driver for status every 10 minutes; automation could save ~2 hours per supervisor daily.
- Drivers are open to sharing GPS as long as they can pause tracking when off shift and receive faster payouts.
- Customers trust WhatsApp updates more than SMS; they'd like bilingual Portuguese/English templates for tourists.
- Cellular coverage gaps occur in tunnels and dense downtown areas—need caching and store-and-forward messaging.
