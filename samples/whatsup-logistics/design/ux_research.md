# WhatsUp Logistics Rapid Research Snapshot
- **Question:** Will riders acknowledge ETA updates and use quick replies?
- **Audience:** 6 riders + 4 senders in São Paulo, mixed device types
- **Channel:** WhatsApp scripted conversation with clickable quick replies

## Protocol
- 10-minute remote sessions; simulated pickup + delivery events
- Stimuli: PT-BR templates, one emoji-light, one emoji-rich
- Success signals: correct quick reply usage, comprehension of SLA language, no PII oversharing

## Findings
- Riders prefer opt-in frequency control; add "every 15/30/60 min" quick replies
- Two participants confused by street-level location; change to neighborhood + distance
- Template rejection observed once → keep SMS fallback

## Actions
- Update CX guardrails and design flows with frequency toggle
- Log feature asks for data/ML (quick-reply usage, rejection rate)
