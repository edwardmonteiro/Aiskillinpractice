# Skills Release Audit Trail

Use this workspace to track each tagged update to the Claude Skills catalog.

## How to use

1. Run `governance.skill_release` with the scope of the upcoming release.
2. Save the generated brief to `ai/<timestamp>.md` (for example, `ai/2025-03-18T1200Z.md`).
3. Link the brief from the pull request and tag announcement (for example, `skills/v1.4.0`).
4. Append any post-release notes or remediation tasks after squads adopt the new prompts.

Keeping these briefs under version control makes it easy to audit how the skills evolved and which squads consumed each release.
