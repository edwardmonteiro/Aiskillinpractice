# Claude Skills Repository Field Guide

Welcome to your AI-first delivery workspace. This field guide shows product and engineering teams how to explore the repository, understand the Claude skills catalog, and walk through the WhatsUp Logistics sample application. Follow it end to end the first time you onboard a new squad—after that, each section doubles as a quick reference.

## 1. Quick start checklist

| Step | Why it matters | Command or link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Install the enumerator | Gives every agent (local or cloud) the same view of the catalog. | `chmod +x scripts/list-skills && cp scripts/list-skills ~/bin/`
| 2. Validate the catalog | Catches metadata drift before skills reach teammates. | `scripts/validate-skills`
| 3. Point Codex (or your agent) at the repo | Ensures Codex, Windsurf, Devin, or any other assistant reads the same skills. | Configure `skillsEnumerator` to use `~/bin/list-skills` and `skillsDir` to point at this repo.
| 4. Connect MCP servers | Adds the sample catalog + executor MCP servers so agents can discover skills programmatically. | Follow [`docs/mcp-integration-guide.md`](mcp-integration-guide.md) then run `codex skills run delivery.mcp_session`.
| 5. Launch the guide | Serve the lightweight web app so non-builders can browse the playbooks. | `python -m http.server 8000` → visit [http://localhost:8000/webapp/](http://localhost:8000/webapp/)

> **Tip:** When onboarding, screen-share the web app while you run the steps above so the whole team sees the same reference material.

## 2. Repository atlas

Everything in this repo revolves around a single source of truth—the `skills/` directory. The rest of the folders organize how those skills are planned, applied, and showcased.

| Path | Contents | How to use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `skills/` | Lifecycle-organized Claude Skills (`discovery`, `definition`, `delivery`, `run`, `optimization`, `governance`) with one `SKILL.md` per skill. | Treat each `SKILL.md` like executable documentation. Update metadata first, then body. Keep changes versioned with Git branches and pull requests, and maintain the `Toolchain & Integrations`, `Human Layer`, and `Critical Thinking Loop` sections so collaborators know which scripts, mindsets, and adaptive moves accompany the prompt. |
| `scripts/list-skills` | Enumerator script that agents run at startup to list skills without reading every file. | Copy onto your PATH, run it in CI, and pin to releases when the catalog evolves.
| `scripts/validate-skills` & `scripts/_skills_utils.py` | Validation CLI plus helpers that enforce naming, directory alignment, and metadata structure. | Add to pre-commit hooks and CI pipelines. Block merges that fail validation.
| `docs/digital-product-team-howto.md` | Deep-dive playbook covering lifecycle rituals, role playbooks, and detailed command samples. | Pair this with the web app for day-to-day reference when you need specifics about a phase or role.
| `docs/case-studies/whatsup-logistics.md` | Narrative case study highlighting the WhatsUp Logistics journey. | Share with stakeholders who want the story behind the sample artifacts.
| `specs/` | AI-first software design workspace modeled after github/spec-kit. Includes templates and live SDDs. | Keep SDDs in sync with the skills they reference. Update after every material change.
| `samples/whatsup-logistics/` | Full lifecycle artifact set generated by the skills catalog. | Use as a baseline to gauge the level of detail your own outputs should reach.
| `mcp/` | Sample Model Context Protocol servers and manifests. | Register with MCP-aware agents so they can stream skills and call repo automation safely.
| `webapp/` | Static site that renders any Markdown guide in this repo with a TOC, search, and download button. | Host internally or share over a VPN so distributed teams can browse without cloning the repo.

## 3. Skills as the single source of truth

1. **Track skills like code**
   - Branch naming: `skills/<initiative>-<skill>` keeps history readable.
   - Pull requests: require approvals from a skills maintainer and a consuming team lead.
   - Releases: tag bundles with `skills/v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` and publish release notes using `governance.skill_release`.

2. **Automate governance**
   - Run `scripts/validate-skills` locally and in CI to catch schema changes, missing metadata, or misaligned directories.
   - Record validation output in pull requests so reviewers can trust the automation.

3. **Keep agents synchronized**
   - Local IDE agents (e.g., Windsurf) should read `skills/` directly from the repo clone.
   - Cloud agents (e.g., Devin) load the same set via the enumerator. Share the enumerator path and `skills` revision in hand-off notes generated by `delivery.agent_collaboration`.
4. **Document toolchains and human guardrails**
   - Populate the `Toolchain & Integrations` section in every skill so Python CLIs, external APIs, and MCP servers stay discoverable.
   - Expand the `Human Layer: Reflective Practice` and `Critical Thinking Loop` sections with prompts your team uses to check emotions, audience expectations, and pivots.
   - Update entries whenever new scripts, sandboxes, integrations, or team rituals evolve alongside the prompts.

## 4. WhatsUp Logistics walkthrough

Use the WhatsApp-native delivery tracker as a working example of every skill in motion.

### 4.1 Start with discovery
- Browse `samples/whatsup-logistics/discovery/` for artifacts created by the discovery skill suite. Each Markdown file mirrors the default `SKILL.md` output structure.
- Cross-reference the case study at [`docs/case-studies/whatsup-logistics.md`](case-studies/whatsup-logistics.md) to understand the business context for each artifact.

### 4.2 Shape the definition
- Open `samples/whatsup-logistics/definition/` to see the OKRs, story map, tech spike, and other assets produced via the `definition.*` skills.
- Compare the contents with the AI-first SDD located at [`specs/projects/whatsup-logistics/sdd.md`](../specs/projects/whatsup-logistics/sdd.md) to confirm how strategic decisions flow into engineering plans.

### 4.3 Deliver with aligned agents
- Review `samples/whatsup-logistics/delivery/` for collaborative outputs such as the agent handshake (`agent_collaboration.md`), MCP session summary (`mcp_session.md`), tech spec, test plan, and release notes.
- Note how the handshake records responsibilities for Windsurf (local) and Devin (cloud) agents, ensuring they share the same Claude skills and spec context.
- When MCP servers are in play, follow [`docs/mcp-integration-guide.md`](mcp-integration-guide.md) and run `delivery.mcp_session` to capture how catalog and executor servers are connected before implementation starts.

### 4.4 Run the service
- Inspect `samples/whatsup-logistics/run/` for the production runbook and live incident plan powered by the new `run.service_runbook` and `run.incident_response` skills.
- Copy SLIs/SLOs, escalation paths, and WhatsApp-ready communication templates directly into your own on-call documentation.
- Pair these outputs with `optimization.postmortem` to close the loop on reliability learnings.

### 4.5 Measure and govern
- Inspect `samples/whatsup-logistics/optimization/` and `samples/whatsup-logistics/governance/` for experiment briefs, metric reviews, and skill release notes.
- For provenance, open [`samples/whatsup-logistics/skill-run-log.json`](../samples/whatsup-logistics/skill-run-log.json) to trace every skill invocation, including timestamps, variables, and resulting files.

### 4.6 Recreate the flow
Run the following commands to replay the case study pattern for your own product:

```bash
# 1. Create a fresh branch and copy the sample workspace
cp -R samples/whatsup-logistics samples/<your-product>

# 2. Regenerate artifacts with your own variables
codex skills run discovery.user_research \
  --vars "product=<your-product>" "persona=Logistics manager" \
  --output samples/<your-product>/discovery/user_research.md

# 3. Capture an agent handshake before delivery work starts
codex skills run delivery.agent_collaboration \
  --vars "initiative=<your-product>" "local_agent=Windsurf" "cloud_agent=Devin" \
  --output samples/<your-product>/delivery/agent_collaboration.md

# 4. Update the AI-first SDD using the template
codex skills run delivery.ai_delivery_sdd \
  --vars "feature=Realtime courier tracking" "objectives=Increase ETA accuracy" \
  --output specs/projects/<your-product>/sdd.md
```

Check the new artifacts into Git alongside an updated run log so others can audit the process.

## 5. Share the knowledge base

1. **Launch the web app**
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Navigate to [http://localhost:8000/webapp/](http://localhost:8000/webapp/) and select the guide you want to present. The selector now includes this field guide, the implementation playbook, and the WhatsUp Logistics case study.
   - Use the "MCP Integration Guide" option to walk teammates through wiring the sample servers into their agents.

2. **Offer downloads**
   - Use the “Download Markdown” button in the web app to share the exact file with teammates who prefer offline reading.
   - Export to PDF by running `npx @marp-team/marp-cli docs/repository-field-guide.md --pdf` if you need a printable version.

3. **Record sessions**
   - When running enablement workshops, log which sections you cover and attach recordings or notes to `specs/projects/skills-releases/` for future cohorts.

## 6. Extend for new teams

- **Clone the sample structure**: Copy the `samples/` workspace to bootstrap artifacts for the next product team.
- **Add bespoke skills**: Create a new folder under `skills/<phase>/` with an explanatory `SKILL.md`. Re-run `scripts/validate-skills` and update this guide with a short description.
- **Update agent agreements**: Whenever a new tool joins the stack, run `delivery.agent_collaboration` again so local IDE and cloud agents share expectations.
- **Celebrate releases**: Document major skill catalog updates using `governance.skill_release` and announce them via internal channels, linking back to this field guide for context.

Your organization now has a repeatable, auditable way to pair human expertise with Claude Skills across discovery, definition, delivery, run, optimization, and governance. Share this guide widely and keep iterating as your catalog evolves.
